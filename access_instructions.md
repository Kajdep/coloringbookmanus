# Line Art Coloring Book Generator - Access Instructions

## Accessing Your Deployed Application

Once you've deployed the Line Art Coloring Book Generator to Render.com following the instructions in `render_deployment.md`, you'll be able to access your application through a permanent URL.

### Your Application URL

After successful deployment on Render.com, your application will be available at:
```
https://[your-service-name].onrender.com
```

Where `[your-service-name]` is the name you chose during the Render.com setup (e.g., `line-art-generator`).

### Sharing Your Application

You can share this URL with others who want to use your line art generator. The application is publicly accessible to anyone with the URL.

## Using Your Deployed Application

### First-Time Setup

1. When you first access your deployed application, you'll need to ensure your Stability AI API key is properly configured:
   - Verify in the Render.com dashboard that the `STABILITY_API_KEY` environment variable is set correctly
   - Check the application status by looking at the "API Status" indicator in the footer

2. Generate a test image to confirm everything is working properly:
   - Use the "Generate Preview" button to create a single test image
   - If successful, you're ready to use all features of the application

### Regular Usage

Using the deployed application is identical to using the local version:

1. Configure your desired settings in the control panel
2. Generate preview images to test your settings
3. Create batches of 45-60 images when you're satisfied with the preview
4. Download individual images or entire batches as ZIP files

### Performance Considerations

The deployed application on Render.com's free tier has some limitations:

1. **Processing Speed**: Image generation may be slower than on a local machine
2. **Concurrent Users**: The free tier has limited resources for multiple simultaneous users
3. **Sleep Mode**: Free tier services on Render.com "sleep" after periods of inactivity, causing the first request after inactivity to take longer

For improved performance, consider upgrading to a paid Render.com plan.

## Maintaining Your Application

### Updating Your Application

To update your deployed application:

1. Make changes to your local files
2. Run the `prepare_deployment.sh` script to create a new deployment package
3. Follow the update instructions in `render_deployment.md`

### Monitoring Usage

Monitor your application's usage through:
1. Render.com dashboard for server metrics
2. Stability AI dashboard for API usage and remaining credits

## Troubleshooting Access Issues

If you or your users encounter problems accessing the deployed application:

1. **Application Not Loading**:
   - Check the Render.com dashboard to ensure your service is running
   - Verify there are no deployment errors in the logs
   - The free tier may take 30-60 seconds to "wake up" if it hasn't been used recently

2. **Image Generation Failures**:
   - Verify your Stability AI API key is valid and has sufficient credits
   - Check the Render.com logs for any API-related errors
   - Ensure your account has permission to use the Stability AI models

3. **Slow Performance**:
   - Reduce batch sizes for better performance
   - Lower resolution settings if generation is too slow
   - Consider upgrading to a paid Render.com plan for better performance
